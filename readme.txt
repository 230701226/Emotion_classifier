#  DESCRIPTION OF TASK

This project is an advanced **Emotion Classification System** built using `DistilBERT` and fine-tuned on the **GoEmotions dataset** from Google AI .

The goal was to create a system that accepts any English sentence and predicts the most relevant emotions associated with it. The model supports:

 **Multi-label classification** (multiple emotions per sentence)  
 **Top-3 emotion prediction** with confidence scores  
 Deployed with a beautiful **Gradio UI** on **Hugging Face Spaces**

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python
- HuggingFace Transformers 
- DistilBERT
- GoEmotions dataset
- Torch
- Gradio
- HuggingFace Spaces

# HOW TO RUN ON HUGGING FACE SPACES

1. Clone or fork the repository:
```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/your-username/emotion-classifier
Make sure app.py and requirements.txt are present.

Push the files to your Hugging Face Space repo:

bash
Copy
Edit
git lfs install
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push
HuggingFace will automatically detect app.py and launch the app.

üß™ SAMPLE WORKING INPUTS
These inputs give logically correct emotion outputs:

Input Sentence	Expected Emotions
I just got promoted today at work!	joy, excitement, pride
I'm feeling so lonely and tired lately.	sadness, disappointment, loneliness
